Simple react app that generates a hostname in the format `adjective*n+noun`.

### Disclamer

This app is using large dictionaries, and, in some cases, may produce output that can be offensive.
I encourage you to open an issue if you encounter something that, in your opinion, should be removed from dictionaries.
